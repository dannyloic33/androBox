# Install

Paste this command in terminal:

>cd $HOME && rm -rf ~/setup.sh && curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannyloic33/androBox/androBoxNew/setup.sh -O && bash setup.sh

# Simple Usage

From's today update to launch androBox, you can just type androBox in terminal and follow instructions on screen. After updating you will get a black screen or it may not work, that's normal. Force close Termux and Termux:X11 and use new command to launch
